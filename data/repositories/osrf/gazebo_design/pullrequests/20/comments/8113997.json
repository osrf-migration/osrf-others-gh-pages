Yes, good point. I also plan to have a `CreateMesh(common::Mesh)` function in `Scene` that returns a `Mesh` geometry.

But you will have to assign your own `Material` separately.\n    * I don't envision having a `CreateMaterial(common::Mesh)` function, as the resulting material will most likely be mesh-specific, so there is no reason why one wouldn't just use `CreateMeshVisual`.
