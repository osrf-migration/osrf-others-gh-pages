This feature predates the model editor, but now that we have the model editor, is the extra trouble of handling mass / inertia changes during simulation justified? Would it make sense to simply remove the tool from simulation and leave it only in the editor?\n\n1. The scaling tool only works for simple shapes ([issue #1473](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1473/gui-resize-tool-doesnt-work-for-all-shapes)), will we be expanding it? I think the main issue scaling whole models is keeping relative positions of links and joints, but then again, if we're in the model editor, we're scaling individual links, which should be fine ([issue #1444](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/gazebo/issues/1444/enable-scaling-meshes-in-model-editor)) \n\n", "markup": "markdown", "html": "<p>About shape resizing with the GUI during simulation, we've talked about a few points which I think would be worth mentioning here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>This feature predates the model editor, but now that we have the model editor, is the extra trouble of handling mass / inertia changes during simulation justified?
